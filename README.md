# Description
Ludo made in C++ using sfml
# Contains
  Solo / Team
  
  Upto 6 Players
  
  Upto 4 Pieces per player
  
  Stunning Visuals ( i'm sorry )
# Note
1) When you select 4/6 number of Players it gives you the choice of single or multiplayer. Team players can move each others pieces and unlock them but can't capture them.
2) Cannot capture pieces on safe (colored) squares
3) First player to home all their pieces wins
4) Didnt create a winning screen rather it just closes the window and prints which player won on the console
